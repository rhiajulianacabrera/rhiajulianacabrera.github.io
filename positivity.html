    <span class="label label-success">Highly Recommended!</span><h2>Tips for good mental health and well-being</h2>
<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">1. Getting plenty of sleep - Sleep is really important for our physical and mental health. Sleep helps to regulate the chemicals in our brain that transmit information. These chemicals are important in managing our moods and emotions. If we don't get enough sleep, we can start to feel depressed or anxious.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">2. Eating Well and Healthy - Eating well isn't just important for our bodies, but it's also important for our minds. Certain mineral deficiencies, such as iron and vitamin B12 deficiencies, can give us a low mood. Try to eat a balanced diet. If you find you're a particularly stressed or anxious person, you should try limiting or cutting out caffeine as this can make you feel jittery and anxious.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">3. Connect with others and be sociable - maintain good relationships and talk to people whenever you get the chance. Having friends is important not just for your self-esteem, but also for providing support when you're not feeling too great.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">4. Surround yourself with good people - People with strong family or social connections are generally healthier than those who lack a support network. Make plans with supportive family members and friends, or seek out activities where you can meet new people, such as a club, class or support group.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">5. Value yourself - Treat yourself with kindness and respect, and avoid self-criticism. Make time for your hobbies and favorite projects, or broaden your horizons. Do a daily crossword puzzle, plant a garden, take dance lessons, learn to play an instrument or become fluent in another language.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">6. Quiet your mind - Try meditating, Mindfulness and/or prayer. Relaxation exercises and prayer can improve your state of mind and outlook on life. In fact, research shows that meditation may help you feel calm and enhance the effects of therapy.</li>
   <li class="list-group-item">7. Set realistic goals- Decide what you want to achieve academically, professionally and personally, and write down the steps you need to realize your goals. Aim high, but be realistic and don't over-schedule. You'll enjoy a tremendous sense of accomplishment and self-worth as you progress toward your goal.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">8. Practicing gratitude can help you to see your life differently. For example, when you are stressed, you may not notice that there are also moments when you have some positive emotions. Gratitude can help you to recognize them.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">9. Developing a sense of meaning and purpose in life. This could be through your job, volunteering, learning new skills, or exploring your spirituality.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">10. Avoiding <strike>NEGATIVITY</strike>. It's important to try to have a positive outlook; some ways to do that include
Finding balance between positive and negative emotions. Staying positive doesn't mean that you never feel negative emotions, such as sadness or anger. You need to feel them so that you can move through difficult situations.</li>
